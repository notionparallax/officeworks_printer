# Officeworks Printer

- Do you live in Australia?
- Do you need to print a lot of unique [A5 booklets](https://www.officeworks.com.au/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/officeworks/PrintAndCopyProductView?catalogId=10551&storeId=10151&productname=bookletsretail)?
- Are you lazy?

I didn't think so. You should do something fun and productive with your life.

## But if you do...

You're in the right place!

I needed to do exactly that, so I made a script to do the uploading for me.

[Officeworks](https://www.officeworks.com.au/ has a good product for a good price, but it's not easy to upload a lot of documents as there's a lot of clicking involved. That's fine for 2&ndash;3, but by 4 it's starting to get pretty tiring.

This script has a lot of baked in variables because it's set up for me. If anyone ever finds this and wants to use it, raise an issue and I'll make it easier to use.
